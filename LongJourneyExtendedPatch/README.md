# TW3-LongJourneyExtendedPatch
Extension of the Long Journey Extended mod for The Witcher 3

I studied the [Long Journey Extended mod for The Witcher 3](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/1630/?tab=description&BH=1) to adapt it to something I wanted to do for a second playthrough of the Witcher 3 - disable the teleport straight to the Hangman Tree and instead go from Vizyma / White Orchard to the Nilfgaard garisson in the south of Velen.  I wanted to have to ride up to the Hangman tree.

I ended up with a few tweaks:

- a solution to the issue of fast traveling to unknown/undiscovered signposts

- conditional routes that unlock after a certain destination is known (a ferry on the Pontar from Oxenfurt to the Nilfgaard camp in White Orchard for example).

- fast travel to the outskirt of Kaer Morhen in addition to the main entrance 

## Installation

- Install the original Long Journey mod first
- Install the files in this GitHub repo inside "The Witcher 3\Mods\modLongJourneyExtended\" folder
- Run TheWitcher3ModManager.exe to merge the changes with your mods

## Changes to the Fast Travel system

Outside of Fast Travel, the map will show you all known Sign posts as landscape markers.
When attempting Fast Travel, the map will show you only Sign posts unlocked for travel to or from the Sign post you are currently using.

I added a short fast travel route from Mulbrydale to the Hangman tree for people who would want to ride their way from the Southern Nilfgaard camp up to the center of Velen and properly trigger the next stage of the main quest. 

As an alternative, you can fast travel directly from the Southern Nilfgaard camp to the Hangman tree.
